# INTRODUCTION
The Tower of Hanoi is a classic mathematical puzzle that involves three pegs and a number of disks of different sizes. The challenge is to move the entire stack from one peg to another, obeying the rules that a larger disk cannot be placed on top of a smaller one. This project involves implementing the Tower of Hanoi game using the React library and JavaScript, providing an interactive and educational experience for users.

### Project Objectives
•	Develop an interactive and visually appealing Tower of Hanoi game.
•	Utilize React for efficient UI development.
•	Implement the Tower of Hanoi algorithm using JavaScript.

### Project Overview
#### 1.	Tower of Hanoi Problem:
The Tower of Hanoi problem dates back to the 19th century and is frequently used in computer science education. It serves as an excellent example of recursion and algorithmic thinking.

#### 2.	Project Description:
The project involves creating a web-based Tower of Hanoi game where users can interact with the disks, move them between pegs, and attempt to solve the puzzle. React is employed for its component-based architecture, making the UI development modular and maintainable.



#### 3.	Technologies Used:

#### •	React JS
React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Its component-based structure allows for the creation of reusable UI elements, providing a smooth and efficient development process.

#### •	JavaScript
JavaScript is used for the algorithmic implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem. Its versatility and compatibility with web browsers make it an ideal choice for client-side scripting.

# SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The Tower of Hanoi Game system architecture is designed to provide an interactive and seamless user experience while efficiently handling the game logic and user interface. The architecture incorporates React for the front-end development and JavaScript for the algorithmic implementation of the Tower of Hanoi problem.

### Front-End (React)
•	Main component orchestrating the game flow.
•	Manages the overall state of the game.
•	Renders the Game Board, Move Counter, and Restart Button components.

### Game Board Component
•	Displays the three pegs and the disks.
•	Interacts with the Tower Component for handling disk movements.

### Tower Component
•	Represents each peg and manages disk placement.
•	Communicates with the Disk Component for rendering disk visuals.

### Algorithm (JavaScript)
•	Tower of Hanoi Algorithm
•	Implemented in JavaScript.
•	Manages the logic for moving disks between pegs.
•	Ensures adherence to the rules of the Tower of Hanoi problem.


#

# GAME FLOW
### Initialization
•	The game initializes with a set number of disks on the first peg.
•	Disks are visually represented on the UI.

### User Interaction
•	Users interact with the game by clicking on disks and dragging them to the desired peg.
•	The algorithm checks the validity of the move and updates the game state.

### Win Condition
•	The game checks for the completion of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
•	A congratulatory message is displayed upon successful completion.
